## Ghost Runner - A mobile app

Ghost Runner is a fully auditory running application. It tracks the user in real time and produces spatial audio in relation to a prerecorded ghost, thereby giving an immersive running experience.

The current application is an MVP/proof of concept. It runs inside your browser.



Use `phone.html` to test this application on your phone. Make sure you turn on location and enable the browser to give permission for location access (this can be done easily in Firefox). The current ghost runs with 5:40 pace for 10km.
